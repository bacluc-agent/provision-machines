# Best-effort, idempotent seeding of shell history for the AI agent devcontainer.
# Runs on every container start via postStartCommand. A sentinel file makes the
# actual seeding happen only once per (shared) home volume. This script must
# never fail the container start, hence the trailing `exit 0`.
#
# nvm availability in interactive zsh is handled separately and globally via
# /etc/zsh/zshrc in the Dockerfile, so it is intentionally not touched here.
