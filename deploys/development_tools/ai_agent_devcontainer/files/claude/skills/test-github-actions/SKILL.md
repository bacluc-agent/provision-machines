# Testing GitHub Actions workflows

## Replicate each job step locally

Before triggering a workflow run, read the workflow YAML and run each step's commands locally. This catches most failures faster than a CI round-trip:

```bash
cat .github/workflows/<workflow>.yml
```

Run the commands from each `run:` block in your shell, in order, with the same environment (e.g. `uv sync --frozen`, `uv run pytest`). If a step uses an action (e.g. `actions/checkout`), replicate what it does manually.

## Trigger a workflow run

Three ways, in decreasing order of control:

```bash
# 1. dispatch manually, with inputs
gh workflow run <file> --ref <branch> [--field input=value]

# 2. push a branch (triggers on: push)
git push origin <branch>

# 3. open a PR (triggers on: pull_request)
gh pr create --base main --head <branch>
```

For example, to dispatch the verify-renovate workflow in https://github.com/bacluc/provision-machines with the snapshot update input:

```bash
gh workflow run verify-renovate.yml --ref main --field update_snapshot=true
```

## Inspect results

```bash
# list recent runs
gh run list

# show a run's jobs and status
gh run view <id>

# full log output
gh run view <id> --log

# watch a run until it finishes
gh run watch <id>
```

## Run multiple times with different parameters

After changing a workflow, run it multiple times with different parameters to cover the branches of the logic (e.g. `update_snapshot=true` and `update_snapshot=false` for verify-renovate). A single green run does not prove the workflow handles all inputs.
Then make the links to the test runs you triggered transparent, either as response or in the issue or PR you are working on.

## When to use

This skill loads when developing or modifying GitHub Actions workflows.
